# Horiseon Brand Website

## Description
An increasingly important consideration for businesses, web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website. Accessibility is good for businessâ€”for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.

In this project, I refactored the code of Horiseon's brand website to make it more web accessible.

![Horiseon-Brand-Website](https://github.com/aleeshanaxakis/Module-1-Challenge/assets/142005319/ebd16a60-c79e-4d36-ac19-55f96fd069cb)

I used the following acceptance criteria:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

I exceeded expectations and improved the codebase for long-term sustainability by:
- checking that all links are functioning correctly
- increase the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties
- organizing CSS selectors and properties to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements
- including comments before each element or section of the page.

This project taught me a lot about HTML, Git, CSS, and web accessibility.
